# PLP on Scala
## History of Scala
Scala is a programming language created in 2001 by Martin Odersky and was designed with aspects of both functional and object-oriented programming in mind. Scala is mainly used for web design, data processing, and distributed computing. Good sources of information to begin learning Scala can be found in the following sources and more: [My Great Learning's Guide to Scala](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/scala-tutorial/) and Programming in Scala by Martin Odersky.

## Getting Started
### Installation
First, ensure that Java is installed (Java JDK 8 or Open JDK 8).
Next, download and run the correct Scala executable from [here](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/).

### IDE
Turn develop Scala programs, there are a few valid choices. For Java developers, Eclipse and IntelliJ are decent options as there are market addons to extend the base IDEs. However, I chose to work with VS Code as it works with just about any language and has a built in console to quickly compile and execute programs.

### Executing Programs
To run a Scala program, the program must first be compiled. To compile a Scala program, use the command
"scalac SOURCE_FILE.scala".

After compiling, to run a specific program or object with a main function, use
"scala OBJECT_NAME".

### Comments
To write comments in Scala, use either "//" for single line comments or "/* ..... */" for multi-line comments.
